## **Default JavaScript --**

-> Synchronous language (ek ke baad dusra code excute hoga).
-> Single Threaded (ek hi thread pe pura kaam krta hai).

## **Execution Context --**

-> Execute one line of code at a time.
-> Each operation waits for the last one to complete before Executing.
-> Memory Heap is made everytime.
-> Call Stack to execute code one after another.

## **Blocking Code VS Non-Blocking Code :-**

-> Blocking Code blocks the flow of program.
-> It read the file Synchronously.

-> Non-Blocking Code does not block ececution.
-> It read the file Asynchronously.

** On the basis of USE-CASE we use Blocking or Non-Blocking Code.

JS ENGINE [ Memory Heap , Call Stack]  ->   Web API[DOM API, SetTimeout , SetInterval , Fetch()] -> Task Queue

-> JS Engine calls Web API  which contains DOM , fetch(), etc DOM manipulation.
-> Call stack stores Global Execution Context and different functions which execute LIFO order.
-> Web API has a "Register CALL Back" which stores all function need to be given run after the call
-> This register call back is connected to Task Queue which add the call backs to the Call Stack.
-> Task Queue ki jagah hm Fetch() ka use krte hai jisme ki promise ka concept diya hua hai.
-> Fetch() has higher priority than the Task Queue.
